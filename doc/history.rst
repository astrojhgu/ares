Development History
===================
*ares* used to exist as two separate codes: *rt1d* and *glorb*, which were introduced in `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_ and `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1406.4120M>`_, respectively. Since then, the codes have been combined and restructured to provide a more unified framework for doing radiative transfer calculations and modeling of the global 21-cm signal. 

Here's an attempt to keep track of major changes to the code over time, which will be tagged in the bitbucket repository. 

v0.1

This is the version of the code used in `Mirocha et al. (2015) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07868>`_.
