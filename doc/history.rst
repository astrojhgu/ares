Development History
===================
*ares* used to exist as two separate codes: *rt1d* and *glorb*, which were introduced in `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_ and `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1406.4120M>`_, respectively. Since then, the codes have been combined and restructured to provide a more unified framework for doing radiative transfer calculations, modeling of the global 21-cm signal, and exploring all types of parameter spaces using MCMC.

Here's an attempt to keep track of major changes to the code over time, which will be tagged in the bitbucket repository with version numbers.

v0.2
----
Not yet released, but here are some notes as we go:

- Abundance matching implemented, can be used as model for global 21-cm signal. You'll need `mpmath <http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1229/trunk/doc/build/setup.html>`_ to use it.

v0.1
----
This is the version of the code used in `Mirocha et al. (2015) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07868>`_.
