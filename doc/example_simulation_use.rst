Generating Uniform Backgrounds for Use in Simulations
=====================================================
In these examples, we will demonstrate how to generate models for the background ionization and heating rates, which can be fed directly into fully numerical simulations.

To begin, import glorb and initialize something:

:: 

    import glorb


Be sure to talk about return_rc

Also mention approx_highz
