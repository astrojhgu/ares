Parameter Study Given Data
==========================
If we have a dataset in hand, i.e., a realization of the signal as characterized 
by the locations of its extrema, and confidence intervals for each, we can take that information into account when searching parameter space. This is highly advantageous, as it has the potential to exclude large regions of parameter space (if the constraints are decent).
