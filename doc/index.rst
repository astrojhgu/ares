ARES
==============================
The Accelerated Reionization Era Simulations (ARES) code was designed to
rapidly generate models for the global 21-cm signal, the 21-cm angular power
spectrum, and the high redshift galaxy luminosity function.

A few papers on how it works:

- 1-D radiative transfer: `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_.
- Uniform backgrounds \& global 21-cm signal: `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1406.4120M>`_.


Currently, ARES has support for the following:
    * Evolution of mean cosmic radiation backgrounds, from the infrared through 
      hard X-rays.
    * Models for the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm background.
