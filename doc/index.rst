ARES
==============================
The Accelerated Reionization Era Simulations (ARES) code was designed to
rapidly generate models for the global 21-cm signal. It can also be used as a 
1-D radiative transfer code, stand-alone non-equilibrium chemistry solver, or
global radiation background calculator.

A few papers on how it works:

- 1-D radiative transfer: `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_.
- Uniform backgrounds \& global 21-cm signal: `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1406.4120M>`_.
