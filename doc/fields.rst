Field Listing
=============
There are really three different kinds of quantities that might be associated
with an *ares* calculation:

- Grid quantities: first initialized in :class:`Grid<ares.static.Grid>`
- Field quantities
- Derived quantities



The most fundamental quantities associated with any calculation done in ares
are the gas density, ionized fractions of hydrogen and helium, the electron density, 
and the gas kinetic temperature. However, there are also derived quantities
like the neutral hydrogen excitation (or ``spin'' temperature), the 21-cm
brightness temperature, and rate coefficients that govern the time evo

- For Global21cm calculations, we operate within two-zone framework most of the time.
