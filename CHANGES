Important Changes
-----------------
A lot of updates to the code-base may not affect the typical user, as they
tend to influence internals rather than call sequences and such.

Some changes, however, *will require users to update custom scripts and calls
to ares from within other packages.* Below is a history of such changes:

2015-01-28
    Keyword argument ``color_by_nu``, prevalent in ``ModelSet`` class, has 
    been renamed ``color_by_like``.

2015-01-21
    Model grids and MCMC fits are now analyzed using the same class, 
    called ``ModelSet`` in ``ares.analysis``. This was formerly called
    ``ModelFit`` -- a class that is now deprecated.

2015-01-08
    Changed some naming conventions. The parameters ``approx_xray`` and 
    ``approx_lya`` are now ``approx_xrb`` and ``approx_lwb``. Also introduced
    related parameters ``discrete_xrb`` and ``discrete_lwb`` to determine 
    whether to integrate the transfer equation by brute force, or to 
    discretize in redshift and frequency.
